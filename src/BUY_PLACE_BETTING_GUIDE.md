## 🎓 Strategy Tips

### **For Beginners:**

- Use **"BET ACROSS"** button to bet all numbers at once
- Keep bets small until you understand the game

### **For Advanced Players:**
- **Buy 4 and 10** instead of placing them (better odds even with vig)
- **Place 6 and 8** instead of buying (commission makes buy worse)
- In crapless craps, **Buy 2, 3, 11, 12** for huge payouts (but rare hits)

### **Optimal Strategy:**
```
BUY:   4, 10, 2, 3, 11, 12  (True odds worth the commission)
PLACE: 5, 6, 8, 9            (Small house edge, no vig)
```

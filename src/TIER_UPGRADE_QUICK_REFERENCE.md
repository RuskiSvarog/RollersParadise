**You need:**
- ~10,000 registered players (10% concurrent rate)
- OR ~5,000 very active players (20% concurrent rate)

**Tier needed:**
- **Full Stack ($50/month)** = 1200 safe capacity ✅

**Timeline estimate:**
- Month 1: 50 players
- Month 3: 200 players
- Month 6: 1,000 players
- Month 12: 5,000 players → ~500 concurrent
- Month 18: 10,000 players → **1,000 concurrent!** 🎉

## **⚡ QUICK DECISION TREE**

```
Are you at 80% capacity?
├─ NO → Keep monitoring
└─ YES → Is revenue > next tier cost × 2?
    ├─ YES → ✅ UPGRADE NOW
    └─ NO → Focus on monetization first
```

## **🔔 ALERT TYPES**

### **🚨 CRITICAL**

If ROI Multiple < 2.0 → Focus on revenue first ❌
```

**Examples:**
- Revenue: $50/mo, Tier: $25/mo → 2.0x ROI → ✅ Good!
- Revenue: $30/mo, Tier: $50/mo → 0.6x ROI → ❌ Too soon!
- Revenue: $200/mo, Tier: $50/mo → 4.0x ROI → ✅ Should've upgraded already!

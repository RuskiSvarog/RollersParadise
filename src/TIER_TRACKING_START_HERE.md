## **🚀 REAL-WORLD EXAMPLE**

**Let's say you're Ruski, checking on January 15, 2026:**

### **You open Admin Dashboard and see:**

Status: MONITOR ⚠️
Concurrent Players: 95 / 150 (63%)

Registered Players: 487
Peak Concurrent: 112
Monthly Revenue: $127
Daily Active Users: 58
```

### **What this means:**

✅ **Good news:**
- You have 487 registered players! (Growing!)

⚠️ **Warning signs:**
- At 63% capacity (approaching 80% threshold)
- Peak was 112 (75% of capacity)
- Status is "MONITOR" not "HEALTHY"

### **What you should do:**

1. **This week:** 
   - Keep monitoring

2. **Next 2 weeks:**
   - Revenue is good ($127 > $50)
   - ROI is positive ($127 ÷ $25 = 5.1x)

3. **When you hit 120 concurrent (80%):**
   - ⚠️ WARNING alert will fire
   - Plan upgrade to Pro in 2-4 weeks
   - You can afford it ($127/month revenue)

4. **Upgrade when:**

## **❓ QUICK FAQ**

**Q: Do I need to do anything right now?**
A: No! Just open the dashboard once to verify it's working. That's it.

**Q: How will I know when to upgrade?**
A: The system will send you alerts. You can't miss them - they're big, red, and pulsing.

**Q: What if I ignore an alert?**
A: Nothing breaks immediately, but if you ignore CRITICAL alerts, performance gets bad and players might leave.

**Q: Can I check this on my phone?**
A: Yes! The admin dashboard works on mobile. Just log in and click the admin button.

**Q: What if I want to upgrade early?**
A: You can! But check the ROI first. If revenue isn't 2x the tier cost, you're paying more than you're making.

**Q: What if I never want to upgrade?**
A: That's fine! The free tier handles 150 concurrent (about 1500 registered players). You can stay there forever.
